## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Solving this challenge, I was able to work properly with CSS media query. Not that I do not know of that before, but it was more tasking even though I ended up using few line for the mobile responsitivity.

### Continued development

I would love to work on more projucts with media queries so that I can master the techniques and guildlines of it.

### Useful resources

- [Josh Custom CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This helped me for debugging CSS sizing and stylings. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
